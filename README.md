## Description

This Partner Reference Application repository provides you with a “golden path” for becoming a SaaS provider of multi-tenant applications. It is based on the SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) ABAP environment and extends SAP S/4HANA Cloud.

The guidance covers building, running, and integrating scalable applications using ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP). It features a design that let's you to deliver your application as a side-by-side extension for consumers using SAP S/4HANA Cloud. This ensures seamless integration and scalability. Such side-by-side extensions can also be integrated with other SAP solutions or non-SAP solutions.

By leveraging the SAP BTP ABAP environment and the ABAP RAP model, your application aligns with SAP’s standards for enterprise-grade business solutions. It offers a consistent, harmonized user experience and robust integration capabilities, including:

- A clean core architecture that ensures upgrade stability and independent lifecycle management.
- A scalable ABAP Cloud development model, empowered by ABAP RAP for efficient and extensible design.
- Secure, reliable, and future-proof integration with SAP S/4HANA Cloud.

The repository includes the **Music Festival Manager** application as a ready-to-run example. It also provides step-by-step tutorials to build, run, and deploy the application from scratch using an incremental development approach.

Based on this sample application, you will find the bill of materials and a sizing example. This addresses the question: "Which SAP BTP resources do I need to subscribe to and in what quantities?" It serves as a basis for cost calculation.

### About the Sample Application *Music Festival Manager*

Imagine you're an event manager, like Peter, whose job is to organize and host music festival events.

Your company uses SAP S/4HANA Cloud to run its business. You rely on its project management component to plan and staff events, collect costs, and purchase equipment. An SAP partner also provides a side-by-side application called **Music Festival Manager**. This application helps you publish music festival events and manage bookings for visitors and artists, such as Julie.
