# Bill of Materials
In the full version of the **Music Festival Manager** application with multitenancy, SAP ERP integration, and additional features, the **Music Festival Manager** application  uses a number of subaccounts and entitlements.
These subaccounts include two types: a provider subaccount, where the application is deployed, and consumer subaccounts, which contain customer-specific information and configuration.
To find an overview on how to set up your SAP BTP subaccounts as a SaaS solution operator, refer to [How to Set Up a Global Account for Development](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/prepare#set-up-a-global-account-for-development) and [How to Set Up a Global Account for Production](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/prepare#set-up-a-global-account-for-production).
